## Introduction

This is a web application that lets you play tic tac toe with another player. It is built with preact and typescript.

## Usage

You will see a 3x3 grid with empty squares. Click on a square to mark it with an X or an O, depending on your turn. The first player to get three marks in a row, column or diagonal wins the game. If all the squares are filled and no one wins, the game is a draw.

## Tecnologies

- Preact: a fast and lightweight alternative to React
- Typescript: a superset of JavaScript that adds static types
